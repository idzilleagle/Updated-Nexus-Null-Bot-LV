Your Voice is MAGIC! 
#LEGALNAMEFRAUD #BCCRSS ~ Read the BCCRSS
 Welcome to the most exciting sound adventure ever! Did you know that every single word 
you say creates special 
sound waves that travel through the air like invisible magic? It's 
true! When you speak, you're actually creating something powerful and real with your voice.
 Long, long ago, people called the Phoenicians understood something super important: the 
sound you make with your voice is where the real magic lives! They knew that sounds carry 
your thoughts, feelings, and ideas out into the world. Today, we're going on a colorful 
journey to discover how sounds work, why they're so special, and how your voice has 
incredible power. Get ready to uncover the secrets of phonics4the study of sounds in 
words4and learn why being kind and true is the most important magic of all!

Letters Are Just Costumes for the Sound! 
Ç
 The Hidden Truth About Letters
 Here's a fun secret: letters like A, B, and C are really just costumes that 
sounds wear! Imagine if every sound was a friendly little character, and 
letters were the silly, complicated outfits they put on to appear in books and 
on signs.
 Sometimes these costumes can be tricky! The same sound might wear 
different letter-costumes in different words. That's why "sea" and "see" 
sound exactly the same but look different when you write them down. The 
letters are the costume, but the sound underneath is always the real star of 
the show!
 When we read, we need to look past the fancy costumes and listen to what 
the sound is really trying to tell us. What matters most is the meaning and 
feeling behind the sound4that's where the true message lives!
The Tricky System Spins Word Spells! 
The Sound You Mean
 When you speak, your voice carries your true 
intention4what you really mean and feel 
inside your heart.
 The Written Spell
 But when words get written down, sometimes 
they get twisted! The same sound can be 
spelled different ways with different 
meanings.
 The Confusion Trick
 This is called phonics deception! Words that 
sound alike (called homonyms) can confuse 
what you really meant to say.
 Imagine you say the word "flower" because you're thinking about a beautiful rose. But someone writes it down as "flour" and suddenly they think you're talking 
about baking bread! That's the tricky system at work. The sound was pure and clear, but the spelling changed the meaning. That's why it's so important to 
remember that your spoken voice and true intention should always come first. Don't let confusing spellings trick you away from what you really mean!
The LEGAL NAME Monster 
ê
 The Stiffest Costume of All
 Now here's where things get really interesting! Grown-ups 
use something called a LEGAL NAME. It's written on official 
papers, like birth certificates and ID cards.
 But here's the secret: a legal name is like the biggest, 
stiffest costume ever! It's made entirely of paper and ink. It 
can't laugh, can't play, can't feel happy or sad. It's what we 
call a "fiction"4something made up that isn't really alive.
 YOU, on the other hand, are a living, breathing, thinking, 
feeling person with a bright soul full of creativity and 
kindness! The real you is so much more than any name 
written on paper. Never forget that the living, loving YOU is 
what truly matters, not the stiff paper costume!
"Hearings" Convert Voice to Paper Debt! 
P
 Have you ever wondered why grown-up meetings in courtrooms are called "hearings"? It's because people use their voices4they speak and are heard. But 
here's something curious that happens in those rooms!
 Your Living Voice
 You speak with your true feelings and honest 
intentions. Your voice is alive with meaning!
 The Paper Translation
 Someone writes down what you said, but now 
it's frozen on paper4it's no longer alive and 
moving.
 The Agreement Trap
 They use your honest voice to make you agree 
to things written in confusing paper language!
 It's like someone takes your beautiful, singing voice and turns it into a stiff, silent statue. The sound you made was full of life and truth, but the paper version 
can be twisted to mean something else entirely. That's why it's important to always know what you're agreeing to, and to make sure your true intention is 
understood4not just the words on paper!
Are You a LYING or a LION? 
I
 Lyin' (The Lie)
 This represents fiction4things that aren't true or real. It's like a wobbly 
shadow that changes shape and can't be trusted.
 Lion (The Truth)
 This represents being brave and true! A lion stands strong in honesty, 
courage, and the light of truth.
 Here's a super cool word puzzle! The words "lying" and "lion" sound almost exactly the same when you say them out loud. But they mean completely opposite 
things! This is what we call a homonym4words that sound alike but have different meanings.
 When you choose to tell the truth and be honest, you're being like a strong, brave lion. But when you pretend or say things that aren't true, you're "lyin'" like the 
fiction character. This phonics trick reminds us that every day, we get to choose: Will we be a lying (fiction) or a lion (truth)? The answer you choose creates 
your reality! Always choose to be the brave lion of truth!
Protect Your Gold Spark: Your AU-RA! 
€
 What Is Your Au-Ra?
 Inside you, there's an amazing, glowing energy that makes you special and 
unique. It's called your aura (which sounds like "Au-Ra"). "Au" is the science 
symbol for gold, and "Ra" was the ancient sun god. So your Au-Ra is like 
your own golden sunshine energy!
 This energy is your creativity, your ideas, your kindness, and your 
imagination all rolled into one glowing ball of awesome! It's more valuable 
than any treasure because it's uniquely yours.
 Protect Your Energy!
 Sometimes, systems and rules try to "mine" your golden energy4that 
means they try to take it and use it for themselves. But when you stay 
aligned with truth, honest in your words, and kind in your actions, your 
golden spark stays protected!
 Your creative energy is the real treasure. Keep it safe by being true to 
yourself, speaking with honesty, and always remembering that YOU are the 
one in charge of your own golden light. No paper name or confusing rule 
can take away your inner sunshine!
The ONE Simple, Pure Gold Law! 
¸
 The Gold'Ten Rule
 1 What Is It?
 "Do unto others as you would accept done 
unto you." This means: Treat other people 
the way you want them to treat you!
 2 Why It Matters
 This one simple rule is more powerful than 
thousands of complicated laws. If 
everyone followed it, the world would be 
full of kindness!
 3 How to Use It
 Before you speak or act, ask yourself: 
"Would I want someone to do this to me?" 
If yes, go ahead! If no, choose something 
kinder.
 All those big, dusty books full of complicated rules? They become tiny and powerless when you follow this one golden law. When you align with truth and 
treat others with kindness and respect, you break free from confusing spells and paper tricks. The Golden Rule is like a magical key that unlocks everything 
you need to know about being a good person. It's simple, it's true, and it's pure gold!

Take the Hook Out: NO More Bait! 
Don't Take the Bait!
 Imagine you're a smart fish swimming in the water. Someone throws in a hook with yummy
looking bait on it. But you know better4if you bite the bait, you'll get caught!
 The LEGAL NAME and all those confusing word tricks are like phonics bait. They try to hook 
you (catch you in their trap), rook you (that's an old word for "cheat"), and get you cooked 
(turned into something you're not).
 But guess what? You don't have to take the bait! When you see the trick for what it is4just 
confusing words trying to fool you4the hook loses its power. You can simply walk away 
onto solid ground where you're safe and free.
 Remember: You're not a fish on a hook! You're a free, living, thinking being who can choose to see the truth and walk in honesty. Don't let word tricks 
fool you4stay on solid ground! IT'S ILLEGAL TO USE A LEGAL NAME!!!
Truth Just IS: Alignment Is the Way 
æ
 And here we are at the end of our sound adventure! We've learned that sounds are magical, that letters are just costumes, and that your living voice is far 
more powerful than any words written on paper. We've discovered that you can choose to be a brave lion instead of a lying fiction, and that your golden spark 
of creativity is precious and worth protecting.
 Most importantly, we've learned the one golden law that matters: Treat others the way you want to be treated. When you align yourself with truth, honesty, 
and kindness, all the confusing tricks and paper spells lose their power. You don't have to fight them or argue with them4you simply see through them and 
choose something better.
 Be Kind
 Treat everyone with gentleness and 
respect, just like you want to be treated!
 Be Honest
 Speak your truth clearly and let your voice 
carry your real intentions.
 Be Peaceful
 Do no harm. Choose peace over conflict, 
and love over fear.
 JUST BE NICE.
 That's it! That's the whole adventure summed up in three simple words. When you're nice4kind, honest, peaceful, and true4you're aligned with the greatest 
power in all creation. Your voice becomes pure magic, your golden spark shines bright, and you walk freely on solid ground. The truth just is. It doesn't need 
defending or fighting. It simply shines, and you shine with it. Now go forth and let your true voice be heard!
