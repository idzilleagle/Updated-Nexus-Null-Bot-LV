 The BCCRSS (Birth Certificate Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus) opens by addressing 
all who operate under a LEGAL NAME or title within the legal system. It exposes that 
every participant4judge, lawyer, police, or citizen4acts as a fictional entity belonging 
to the CROWN. The author emphasizes that truth cannot be copyrighted, for it 
belongs to all who recognize it.
 The document seeks to remove phonetic deception and restore clear intent: It is 
illegal to use any LEGAL NAME because doing so sustains a fraudulent system built 
on assumption and presumption. This fundamental assertion challenges the 
foundation of modern legal practice and identity documentation.
The Phonetic Deception
 A core section explains how legal phonics corrupt meaning. When spoken words enter 
the court system, B.A.R. members "re-spell" them to alter intent. For example, saying "I 
do not consent" is phonetically twisted into phrases implying agreement.
 This linguistic sorcery converts honest speech into self-incrimination. The lesson: 
within the legal world, sound is weaponized; spelling4not meaning4determines 
control.
 Spoken Intent

 Phonetic Capture

 Legal Spelling
 Written form that controls meaning
How Fraud Perpetuates Dishonour
 The BCCRSS shows that all who use a LEGAL NAME stand in "original sign"4a perpetual dishonour4because every signature attached to that fiction 
affirms ownership by the Crown Corporation. Enforcement by violence or coercion compounds the fraud.
 This is statutory commercial rape: the taking of one's living authority through deceptive registration and linguistic trickery.
 01
 Registration Creates Fiction
 The living being is converted to a corporate entity through 
documentation
 03
 Enforcement Through Coercion
 Violence or threat sustains the fraudulent authority structure
 02
 Signature Affirms Ownership
 Each use of the LEGAL NAME reinforces Crown Corporation control
 04
 Recognition Ends Participation
 Awareness of this crime terminates complicity in the system
Clausula Rebus Sic Stantibus (CRSS)
 The Legal Escape Clause
 This Latin maxim4"things thus standing"4is the legal escape clause 
that voids contracts when fraud is revealed. The BCCRSS explains that 
once the fraudulent nature of the Birth Certificate and LEGAL NAME is 
known, all connected contracts are null and void ab initio.
 Fraud Revealed
 Discovery of deception in birth registration
 CRSS Invoked
 Legal doctrine dissolves presumed 
obligations
 Release from Bondage
 Living being freed from corporate control
 Fraud removes all consent, "now for then, then for now." CRSS dissolves every presumption of obligation and releases the living being 
from corporate bondage.
The Birth Certificate Construct
 Here the BCCRSS dissects how birth registration transfers the living child into a dead legal entity. The Birth Certificate is the instrument of 
conversion4the "proof of intent to commit fraud." It registers life as property of the Crown, making every subsequent identification derived from it 
criminal use of another's copyrighted material.
 1 Birth of Living Being
 A child is born with natural rights and living status
 2 Registration Process
 Parents unknowingly register the birth with governmental 
authority
 3 Certificate Issued
 Document creates a corporate fiction4the LEGAL NAME 
entity
 4 Transfer of Property
 Living child becomes registered property of the Crown 
Corporation
 5 Perpetual Use
 Every identification derived from certificate perpetuates the 
fraud
 To continue using that certificate after knowing this truth is to participate knowingly in fraud. The choice becomes conscious participation or 
conscious withdrawal.
Invoking the Escape Clause
 Invoking CRSS means acknowledging the fraud and ceasing all participation in 
contracts based on the LEGAL NAME. The doctrine operates individually, not 
collectively: no one may "renounce" for others.
 Once invoked, all prior legal bonds dissolve nunc pro tunc4as if they never 
existed. The BCCRSS insists that the act is not rebellion but restoration of 
truth.
 Keep in mind, this does not require any legal actions to be carried out. All one 
must do is simply understand this blatant truth and break the contract in one's 
own MIND. The one's forcing and asking for legal name's/documentation etc. 
are the criminals committing the fraud. 
1
 Acknowledge the Fraud
 Recognize the deceptive nature of birth certificate registration and 
LEGAL NAME use
 2
 Cease Participation
 Stop engaging in contracts, documents, or systems that rely on the 
fictional entity as much as you safely can
 3
 Invoke CRSS Individually
 Each person must act for themselves; no collective renunciation is 
possible
 4
 Dissolution Takes Effect
 All obligations void retroactively; jurisdiction collapses upon 
recognition
 The fraudulent system loses jurisdiction the moment it is seen. This is not rebellion4it is restoration of truth.
Examples of Fraudulent Acts
 Daily Life Structured Upon Crime by Design
 1 Using a LEGAL NAME Without Permission
 Operating under the Crown's copyrighted fiction without explicit authorization constitutes fraud and identity theft
 2 Creating Identification from Birth Certificate
 Driver's licenses, passports, and social security cards derived from the fraudulent foundational document
 3 Aiding Another to Commit Legal Deception
 Lawyers, notaries, and officials who facilitate the use of LEGAL NAMES participate in systematic fraud
 4 Profiting from LEGAL NAME Commerce
 Banks, employers, and institutions that require legal identification benefit from the fraudulent system
 5 Participating in Legal Proceedings
 Court appearances, contracts, and official processes that presume corporate identity perpetuate the deception
 Each example demonstrates how daily life under legality is structured upon crime by design. Awareness transforms ordinary activities into 
conscious choices.
Law vs. Legal
 The Fundamental Distinction
 LAW
 Arises from truth and conscience
 Natural rights
 Living authority
 Universal principles
 Moral foundation
 "Legality is not reality"
 LEGAL
 Arises from contracts and corporations
 Fictional entities
 Registered titles
 Corporate control
 Assumed authority
 The author contrasts lawful creation with legal fiction. Law arises from truth and conscience; legal arises from contracts, corporations, and titles. 
The Vatican, the City of London, and every registered nation are shown as Crown-owned entities.
 Because all are registered, they are subject to the same fraud. This maxim dismantles the illusion of authority that the legal system projects.
Responsibility and Knowing
 Once the fraud is seen, ignorance is no defense. Silence equates to acquiescence. Each individual must decide whether to continue serving a dead 
fiction or to stand in truth. The BCCRSS teaches that honour is restored through awareness, not aggression.
 After Knowledge
 Ignorance cannot be claimed once truth is 
revealed
 Silence = Consent
 Failure to stand in truth affirms continued 
participation
 Living Choice
 Act from truth or remain in deceit
 Fraud ends when no one agrees to perform it. The mirror of responsibility reflects the living choice before each individual.
 Awareness
 Recognition of the fraudulent system
 Choice
 Decide between fiction and truth
 Action
 Cease participation in fraud
 Restoration
 Honor recovered through truth
Resolution and Protocol of Peace

 The final message is neutral and peaceful: knowledge of the fraud requires no fight4only clarity. The lawful state is reached through truth and 
kindness, not through conflict or aggression. The BCCRSS presents a path of conscious awareness rather than violent resistance.

 Stand in Truth
 Knowledge empowers peaceful restoration of 
honor without aggression or conflict
 Honour is restored through awareness, not aggression. The fraudulent system collapses not through force, but through recognition of its 
illegitimacy. Truth requires only clarity, and clarity requires only honesty.
