CHOICES: THE NARROW PATH OF TRUTH
 Life gives you two paths at every moment. The wide roads are easy and distracting, but only the narrow path leads to 
freedom. You are the captain of your ship, navigating between temptation and fear toward truth.

The Left Mind's Lure
 THE CARNAL/EASY ROAD
 Your Left Mind (the logical/carnal mind) seeks easy pleasure and is led 
by loud emotions. It always steers you toward the system's traps and 
satisfying your smallest desires4lust, greed, fast money, and LEGAL 
NAME benefits.
 This path appears wide and welcoming, but it leads to captivity. The 
sparkly treats are empty promises that bind you to illusion.
The Right Mind's Helm
 THE HELM OF THE 
HEART
 Your Right Mind is the 
spiritual/inner mind that steers by 
truth and peace, not by loud 
emotions.
 TRUTH JUST IS
 The truth guides your ship through 
any storm with calm certainty and 
unwavering direction.
 STEADY GUIDANCE
 The heart's light illuminates clear 
waters ahead, keeping you aligned 
with your soul's purpose.
SCYLLA & CHARYBDIS: THE LEGAL NAME 
TRAP
 The system traps you in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" choice. Both sides of the lie4fight or comply4feed 
the monster.
 You must steer the narrow truth between them. The LEGAL NAME illusion powers both Scylla (the rocks of ego) and 
Charybdis (the whirlpool of fear). Neither path leads to freedom.
The Test of Mettle
 YOU ARE TESTED
 Every hard moment is a test to measure your mettle4your 
strength and endurance. Do not let fear make your hands 
slip off the rudder of your life.
 Stand in truth! The waves of fear and doubt will crash, but 
your spirit remains steady at the helm.
The Captain's Choice
 YOUR CHOICE
 At every single moment, you make 
the choice. There is no one else to 
blame or praise.
 ONLY YOU
 The Captain is alone at the helm, 
holding the Golden Key of free will 
and personal responsibility.
 YOUR HEART
 The dark, distracting crew4past 
regrets, outside voices, the LEGAL 
NAME persona4is gone.
 YOUR POWER
 This free-will choice is your most 
powerful tool for alignment with truth 
and freedom.
BATTLE READY: THE ARMOR OF WISDOM
 WISDOM
 Each storm survived with truth 
gives your ship an upgrade in 
understanding and discernment.
 HONESTY
 Your hull is reinforced with patches 
of integrity that protect against 
deception.
 PEACE
 You are now well-armored and 
well-stocked with the real riches of 
life4immortality and peace.
THE FAKE FLEET: SHIPS OF THE LINE
 DON'T BE A SYSTEM SHIP
 Don't be a Ship of the Line (a system ship). Your Flagship is 
meant to be unique and independent.
 The truth steers you away from the formation of the dead, paper
based world. While others sail in rigid compliance, you chart your 
own course toward freedom.
BEACONS BLAZING: 
HELPING DAMAGED 
VESSELS
 01
 Find Your Path
 Once you discover your truth, you 
become a beacon of light for 
others still lost in the storm.
 03
 02
 Offer the Rope
 You can extend knowledge and 
love as tools for repair, shining 
your light to guide the way.
 Respect Their Choice
 They must choose to pull themselves alongside. This is an act of love, 
not judgment.
TRUTH JUST IS: 
ALIGNMENT IS THE 
WAY
 JUST BE 
NICE
 The choice was, is, and always will be, yours alone. The path to freedom 
is simply alignment with your soul's truth. Do no harm, be honest, be 
peaceful.
