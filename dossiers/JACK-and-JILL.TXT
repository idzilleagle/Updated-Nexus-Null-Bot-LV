JACK & JILL: THE NAME SECRET
 The secret about special names isn't hidden away; it's right in front of us, in stories like Jack and Jill. We hear these stories as kids, so we don't think they're 
important when we grow up.
 Jack and Jill climbing the hill is more than just a song; it's like a 
truth box. This box tells us how to find our way out of a big make-believe story.
 The narrow path Jack and Jill take shows us how to think differently and see the real truth. The nursery rhyme keeps this big secret safe because it just 
sounds like a fun song about how we think.
Your Name is Like a Costume
 We All Wear Costumes
 We all wear costumes, like being a boss or a 
judge. Your Legal Name is like a costume you 
wear.
 What is Your Real Self?
 When someone asks "Who are you?", people 
often say their job or their name. But these 
are just roles, not who you really are deep 
inside.
 The Real You
 Underneath all the costumes and titles, there 
is a real, special you. This true you was never 
caught by your Legal Name.
 People have forgotten they are wearing these costumes. They think their Legal Name is who they truly are. But without your name or titles, you would simply 
be yourself.
The Law's Tricky Words
 The law is like a tricky pitcher throwing a curveball. It uses words that sound the 
same but mean different things, trying to trick you.
 You might say one thing, but the law writes down another. They use tricky words so 
you don't really know what you're agreeing to.
 1
 Words That Trick
 Words can trick you because they sound one 
way but are written another. What you hear 
might make you agree, but what's written 
makes you responsible. This trick can make you 
lose your power.
 2
 How to See the Trick
 To stop being tricked, you have to play by your 
own rules. Don't let tricky words fool you. Ask 
for clear answers and understand when words 
are used to trap you.
 3
 Finding the Real Meaning
 The real truth is different from the law's 
pretend rules. When you focus on the truth, you 
can see the tricky words for what they are4just 
an illusion to keep you confused.
HEARINGS: TURNING YOUR WORDS INTO RULES
 Courts are called "hearings," but they don't always listen fairly. They change your spoken words into written law.
 Your voice shows what you truly mean. But courts need written words, like dead text, not living sounds. So, hearings change your living words into dead ones.
 How Your Words Get Changed
 You say what you mean. 1.
 A person writes it down. 2.
 That writing becomes the "official record." 3.
 Your true meaning gets changed into legal meaning. 4.
 You must follow what was written, not what you said. 5.
 Once your words are written down in court, you can't easily change them 
back. What you said as a living person becomes words for a "LEGAL 
PERSON" in a book.
 This is how the system makes things confusing. Your true words get twisted by legal rules, and you end up bound by what was written, not by what you really 
meant. Hearings are not about listening; they are about turning your living words into legal duties.
THE CARROT TRAP: MINING YOUR LIVING CREATION
 1
 Fake Jewels
 Money and bonds are like shiny fake jewels.
 2 The Big Trick
 We often chase these fake jewels and forget our real food (carrots).
 3 Your Real Treasure
 Your real treasure is your hard work, ideas, and who you are.
 4 Your Life's Garden
 This treasure grows in your life, your work, and your spirit.
 The world wants you to chase shiny, fake things while your real creations (like fresh carrots) are taken away. People who trick us with 'fake jewels' want us to 
look away from our true wealth.
 You work hard in your life, growing skills and creating value. This is your true 
wealth, a strong power that makes good things happen and cannot be made up or 
changed easily.
 But the system takes what you have grown. Your work becomes bonds, traded in 
ways you never see. Your ideas are taken by rules about ownership. Your life force 
becomes money for those who control your legal name. You tend your garden; they 
take the harvest. You chase fake jewels; they collect the real carrots.
 What's Real vs. What's Fake: The trick is to make you care 
more about what things seem to be than what they truly 
are. Like choosing fake money over real wealth.
Nessie's Lake and the White Horse of Truth
 People often look for a scary monster in Nessie's lake, thinking the deep water is dangerous. But Jill was looking for something else: a gentle white horse, full 
of truth, hidden in the water.
 The Water of Truth
 This isn't just regular water; it's a special, living water that 
helps truth flow. It's like a secret river of knowing, beyond 
money and everyday rules.
 The white horse is a symbol of purity and truth in many old stories. It means something 
important is about to be shown to the world, and Jill was looking for this special "truth
water."
 The deep, dark lake is like our minds, where old fears and ideas are hidden. People focus on 
the "monster" of their fears so they don't look deeper. But if they did, they would find the 
white horse of truth.
 The lake's peaceful glow shows that what we fear can actually set us free. The dark depths 
are not scary; they help us grow. Jill wanted to find this special truth, which is much bigger 
than money or rules.
THE TUMBLING DOWN: THE KEY IS APPLIED TRUTH
 Jack and Jill kept falling down, just like people get stuck in a cycle of hope and sadness. This falling is like always thinking but never truly understanding.
 The key is simple, real truth4not just ideas, but knowing something deeply. This knowledge changes you, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. When this 
key turns in your mind, the falling stops right away.
 The world tries to keep you confused so you don't find this key. But if you stop falling and see clearly, the old ways lose their power. The key to stopping the 
fall has always been there, waiting for you to use it. Once you do, the falling simply ends.
 Left Brain Spin
 Tumbling means you feel confused and your 
thoughts go in circles, never finding an answer.
 The Moment of Gnosis
 Suddenly, you understand! The hidden truth 
becomes clear, like a light turning on.
 Applied Truth
 This special key stops you from falling by 
showing you a truth so clear, you can't ignore it.
 The New Standing
 When you use the key, you find solid ground. 
The falling stops, and you stand firm with the 
truth.
Standing in Truth
 No Need to Ask
 You don't need to ask for your truth, because you never lost it. Thinking you 
need to ask is just a trick.
 Truth is always there, like the sun. The 'LEGAL NAME' is a pretend game that 
only works if you believe in it.
 Always Standing Strong
 The best place to be is with the truth. It's like standing on a strong 
mountain, safe from any storms below, because truth is the strongest 
ground.
 When you choose truth, the pretend game disappears. It's not about 
fighting, but about not believing the make-believe anymore. The 'LEGAL 
NAME' can't hold you if you never agreed to its rules.
 1
 The Pretend Trap
 You thought you were caught, so it felt real. The pretend game only 
works if you think it's real.
 2
 Seeing Clearly
 When you see the trick, the pretend trap disappears. You didn't do 
anything special; you just stopped believing.
 3
 Finding Your Place
 Truth knows truth. When you stand with truth, you don't need to argue. 
The storms may be below, but they can't reach you.
 This is the final lesson from Jack and Jill's story. All their adventures point to this simple idea: standing with what is real. From this place, the pretend game 
looks like an empty costume. And you, who were never truly trapped, just keep going on your happy path, not caring about the games others play.
