Nameaholics Anonymous
 The Idiot's Guide to Corporate Fiction
 "Hi, I'm [what you think is "your" legal name], and I'm a recovering name-a-holic."
 We cling to the very thing that is killing us physically and spiritually. The LEGAL NAME controls everything, yet we embrace it 
willingly. Truth just is4alignment begins with admission.
Step 1: The Admission of Ownership
 Powerless over our Fictional Friend
 The Admission
 We admitted we were powerless over our LEGAL NAME 
because we willingly handed it all over.
 The Reality
 The Legal Name does all the heavy lifting and the dying. 
We're just passengers in our own fiction.
My Yacht, My House, My Masters
 Everything is a Corporate Rental
 The Illusion of Ownership
 Everything we think we own was bought through a LEGAL 
NAME. The LEGAL NAME is legally owned by the owners of the 
system.
 We own nothing. Congratulations on your voluntary servitude!
The Registration Ritual
 Full Consent, All Day, Every Day
 The Happy Trade
 We happily and fully consented to this trade upon all 
REGISTRATIONS. Every signature, every form, every 
document.
 The Legal Truth
 There isn't a legal thing you can do about it. You signed the 
contract willingly.
The Deepest Truth: The Spell
 Phonics is a Trap, Not a Tool (until you break the spells and are able to see through the deceptions)
 The use of the LEGAL NAME is a truth so simple yet so spellbinding that it controls our very soul. Sound matters more than 
spelling.
 The letters P, H, and R form the hex mirror of rho. The spell is cast through phonics, binding us to corporate fiction through sound 
itself.
The Ego Shield
 Denial is Not a River in Babylon
 The Defense Mechanism
 When confronted, the Nameaholic's first defense is their opinion and ego. They 
armor themselves with denial and justification.
 The Ultimate Reality
 Any and all truth never requires anyone's belief, merely the acceptance or 
denial of it. Truth just is.
The Emotion-Bomb
 Screaming to the Dead Whore Mother

 Justify
 The Nameaholic constantly justifies their attachment to the 
LEGAL NAME fiction.
 Defend
 They defend the very system that enslaves them with emotional 
outbursts.
 Run to Babylon
 They run off screaming to their dead whore mother called 
Babylon or commerce.
The Princess and the P
 Sleep on the Lie, or Remove the Hex
 The Discomfort
 The Nameaholic couldn't be comfortable until the P, the hex mirror of rho, 
was removed from beneath all their illusions.
 The Solution
 It's the lie of the LEGAL NAME you choose to keep that causes the 
disturbance. Remove it and find peace. It's as simple as a CHANGE OF 
MIND.
The Simple, Nice Fix
 No Legal Name in the Land of Commerce
 1
 The Lie
 LEGAL NAME leads to a dead end in corporate fiction.
 2
 The Choice
 It's a lie I could not stand in once my choice to stand in truth 
was made.

 The Alignment
 NO LEGAL NAME in the land of commerce. This is alignment, 
not a fight.
The Grand Exit
 Recovery: Just Be Nice, and KNOW that YOU are NOT A LEGAL NAME!

 The LEGAL NAME is blasphemy against your true self. Recover yourself as the name-a-holics you are. Truth requires no belief, only 
acceptance. Alignment with truth is the only path to freedom.
